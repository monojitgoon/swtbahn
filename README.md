As a safety critical system design, this project is implemented to control over a model railway track layout system. For that purpose, the project contains a client module interface to control and view whole digital train and track control systems, especially a track monitor client to visualize the activity of objects belongs to the model railway track, with necessary information available, a train driver client who can control over train activity and a stellwerk client to decide over route requests from train drivers and to accept and reject their requests from deciding over a interlocking table and an administrator client who can access roles of all other client module along with the management of other users' list. And a server module that communicate with the client model through response and ensure the safety and security of the low-level digital train and track control system against catastrophic situations, e.g., train collisions and analyse the low-level log messages from the digital train and track control systems to diagnose, notify, and predict operational issues with the model railway.
